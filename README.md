# the_pwa_project

Initialising here what I would call a very ambitious project of developing a PWA (Progressive Web App) from scratch because the devs were bored. 
You read that right. 
The roadmap for the current project is kind of hazy at this point. 
Will be figuring out stuff as we go about it.

The target is to develop a very basic progressive web app that blends beautifully with the upcoming android release ie Android 12.
