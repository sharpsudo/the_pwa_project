# The_PWA_Project

Initialising here what I would call a very ambitious project of developing a PWA (Progressive Web App) from scratch because the devs were bored. 
The roadmap for the current project is kind of hazy at this point. 
Will be figuring out stuff as we go about it.

The target is to develop a very basic progressive web app that blends beautifully with the upcoming android release ie Android 12. 


## Workflow

Commits to be pushed out to beta branch initially. Shall be merged with main branch once it passes testing. Though this is unnecessary considering 
the main branch doesn't have any code on it but it'll help build habit and the coding ethic required for when the main branch actually holds code.
